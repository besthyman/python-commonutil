If your queue contains tasks to process, and the queue's bucket contains tokens, App Engine processes as many tasks as there are tokens remaining in the bucket. 

rate: the rate to put token into bucket.
bucket_size: the maximum of token.
token: token is needed to process a task in queue.

max_concurrent_requests: how many tasks are allowed to be processed at the same time.

I set max_concurrent_requests to 1, so it will only require a front instance to hanlde the tasks in this queue.
