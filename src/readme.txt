If you’re using a version of Python 2 earlier than 2.7.3, or a version of Python 3 earlier than 3.2.2, it’s essential that you install lxml or html5lib–Python’s built-in HTML parser is just not very good in older versions.

lxml on google app engine: If you use python2.7 on AppEngine, the lxml library is supported.
local test: sudo apt-get install python-lxml
